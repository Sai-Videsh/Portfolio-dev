# Certificates Folder

Place your certificate PDF files here with the following names:

- `aws-cert.pdf` - AWS Certified Developer Certificate
- `meta-cert.pdf` - Meta Frontend Developer Certificate
- `fullstack-cert.pdf` - Full Stack Web Development Certificate
- `javascript-cert.pdf` - JavaScript Algorithms Certificate

Or update the links in `src/components/Achievements/Achievements.js` to match your file names.

You can also use external links (like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) instead of local files.
